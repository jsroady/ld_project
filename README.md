## Known issues
- paragraph-tokenising method puts chapter titles not separated by whole newline breaks into one long string
- WordNet does not have a synset for 'maria magdalena', conflating instances of Jesus' mother Mary with instances of Jesus' disciple Mary Magdalene

## To do:
- allow user to enable partial matches
- calculate IAA between us on an excerpt
- maybe we don't need POSs
- try changing lines 10-15 of `nel.py` to only 14-15
- package
